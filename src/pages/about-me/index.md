spoiler: let's talk about what I can do for you

Yo I'm Akash. I'm a "software developer". I put that in quotes because I don't like to be defined by labels. And more importantly because "software development" is such a tiny part of what I do/want to do. And I want to talk about some of those projects here,

## Freelance/Contract Work:
I believe this is going to be my bread and butter for now. I tend to think of myself as a software craftsman so I usually don't include the technologies I know when I'm marketing myself, simply because they are the tools that I use to create my craft. Never pay for the complexity of presentation when all you need is results.

Instead I talk about assurance. It's like this, You want to ship a product and I want to help you ship it. And It's that simple. I provide assurance. Assurance that your product is shipped on time. Assurance that your product has high code quality. Assurance that your product has right software architecture. Assurance that you've good infrastructure in place to scale. And it doesn't really matter what your stack is, at what point you are, what is team status, team moral, etc, I'll help you get it to done.

## Critical Thinking:
Critical thinking is essentially an ability to think clearly and rationally about things.

So this usually includes things like,

  - Ability to reason about ones own beliefs and values
  - To connect dots logically between ideas
  - Indetify, Evaluate and Construct arguments
  - Detect inconsistencies and fallacies in the reasoning
  - Solve problems systematically

And everyone I have interacted with has told me that I help them think critically. So, I want to try this out. I want to help you think critically, whatever your problem maybe (critical thinking skills are domain agnostic).

**Want to pick my brain on that?**

## Startup Advice:
I have been studying about startups for a couple of years now, have worked at few of them and tried and failed at launching few of my own. So I belive I have above average skills, knowledge and experience when it comes to startups. And coupled with my ability of think critically I believe I can really help you break through some of the fog of uncertainties that is Startup.

## Essays:
I have been writing a lot since I last published my essay but I haven't published any of my writings. I have this perfectionist mindset and I'd like to change that. Moving forward I'll try to publish at least one essay a week. I'm hoping that they're somehow insightful to you.

## Podcast (Comming Soon):
People keep telling me that I ask really goood questions. I tell them that I'm just naturally curious about things. So I also want to try this new project where I interview people and try to extract out some wisdom from them by just being me ;). Honestly my goal with this podcast is to try and get people to talk with me about things which otherwise I wouldn't get to (more like it'd be harder). Now I'm hoping that what I learn along the way is really helpful to you.
