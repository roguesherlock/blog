spoiler: let's talk about what I can do for you

Yo I'm Akash. I'm a "software developer". I put that in quotes because I don't like to be defined by labels. And more importantly because "software development" is such a tiny part of what I do/want to do. I want to talk about some of those projects here,

1. Freelance/Contracts: I believe this is going to be my bread and butter for now. The biggest criticism I have heard about being a frreelancer/contract is that they don't have skin in the game. i.e. they're not as invested as the owners and so their work is mediocre at best. But I think it's incorret. If you really care about what you do, i.e. your craft, you'll have skin in the game. I always give this carpenter analgoy. A carpenter who really cares about thier work will make the furniture as best as they possibly can simply because a. Their reputation/livlihood depends on them being able to create quality furniture, and b. Because they just simply care about what they create (it's like an art).

And I tend to think of myself as a software craftsman. So I usually don't tend to include the technologies I know when I'm marketing myself simply because they are the tools that I use to create my craft. The buyer shouldn't care what tool I use, they simply care about if I can provide them with high quality product.

So Instead I talk about assurance. It's like this, You want to ship a product, and I want to help you ship it. It's that simple. I provide assurance. Assurance that your product is shipped on time. Assurance that your product has high code quality. Assurance that your product has right software architecture. Assurance that you've good infrastructure in place to scale. And it doesn't really matter what your stack is, at what point you are, what is team status, team moral, etc, I'll help you get it to done.

2. Critical Thinking: Critical thinking is essentially an ability to think clearly and rationally about things. So this usually includes things like,
- Ability to reason about ones own beliefs and values
- To connect dots logically between ideas
- Indetify, Evaluate and Construct arguments
- Detect inconsistencies and fallacies in the reasoning
- Solve problems systematically

And, everyone I have interacted with has told me that I help them think critically. So, I want to try this out. I want to help you think critically, whatever your problem maybe (critical thinking skills are domain agnostic).

3. Startup Advice: I have been studying about startups for couple of years now, have worked at few of them and tried and failed at launching my own. So I belive I have above average skills, knowledge and experience when it comes to startups. And coupled with my ability of think critically, I believe I can really help you break through some of the fog of uncertainties that is startup.

4. Essays: I have been writing a lot since I last published my essay. But I haven't published any of those essays. I have this perfectionist mindset and I'd like to change that. Moving forward I'll try to publish at least one essay a week. I'm hoping that they're somehow insightful to you.

5. Podcast (Comming Soon): People keep telling me that I ask really goood questions. I tell them that I'm just naturally curious about things. So I also want to try this new project where I interview people and try to extract out some wisdom from them by just being me ;). Honestly my goal with this podcast is just one thing, Try and get people to talk with me about things which otherwise I wouldn't get to (more like it'd be harder). Now I'm hoping that what I learn along the way is really helpful to you.
